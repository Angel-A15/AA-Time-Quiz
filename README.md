# Time-Wizards-Quiz

## Project
My goal is to design a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions and a score 
feature. This app will keep track of others' (including myself) knowledge about coding. 

The quiz will have these composed of these features:

* HTML and CSS components that are powered by Javascript

* A timer that starts when the quiz starts and ends the test
when time runs out

* A score storage to save the progress of the user

* Questions with interactive answers; incorrect answers 
will subtract time
